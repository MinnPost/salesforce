In progress:
- salesforce.module
- salesforce_mapping

@TODOS
- rewrite all tests for D8

- Need interfaces for entites:
  - SalesforceMappingInterface
  - SalesforceMappingObjectInterface

- Need to build an entity definition for Salesforce Objects as defined by instance schema

- extend mapping plugins to be able to override all aspects of field mappings

- Modules yet untouched:
  - salesforce_pull
    - EventSubscriberInterface?
  - salesforce_push
    - EventSubscriberInterface?
  - salesforce_soap

- abstract and rip out as much of old .module files as possible
  
- replace Drupal:: calls in class files with Dependency Injection

- replace strings with consistent, drupal-wide text
  e.g. "-- Select --", "--" . t('Select') . "--", "Select Object Type", etc.
  Nobody wants to translate all those.
  
- Replace hooks with interfaces, plugins, event subscribers, etc.

- Automatically pre-add all required Salesforce fields to mappings
  - require that they be mapped
  - require a key radio button be ticked
