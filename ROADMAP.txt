In progress:
- salesforce.module
- salesforce_mapping

@TODOS
- salesforce_mapping:
  - there's no replacement for entity_get_all_property_info()
    - figure out the best way to compile and present property and field info.

- Modules yet untouched:
  - salesforce_pull
    - EventSubscriberInterface?
  - salesforce_push
    - EventSubscriberInterface?
  - salesforce_soap

- convert Salesforce.php to a service
  - rip out as much of salesforce.module as possible
  
- replace Drupal:: calls in class files with Dependency Injection

- replace strings with consistent, drupal-wide text
  e.g. "-- Select --", "--" . t('Select') . "--", "Select Object Type", etc.
  Nobody wants to translate all those.
  
- replace calls to t() with whatever is the standard approach now.

- Create interfaces:
  - SalesforceMapping
  - SalesforceMappingForm


Big picture items:
- Field Mapping is obfuscated and inflexible. It needs to be overhauled, and D8 is a good opportunity to take advantage of new frameworks.
